# üîê Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Email not confirmed" Error

**Problem**: Users get "Email not confirmed" when trying to sign in.

**Solution**: 
- Check your email for a confirmation link from Supabase
- Click the confirmation link to verify your account
- If you don't see the email, check your spam folder
- Use the "Resend Confirmation Email" button in the sign-in modal

**Why this happens**: Supabase requires email confirmation by default for security reasons.

### 2. "Unsupported provider" Error

**Problem**: OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) show "Unsupported provider" error.

**Solution**:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Providers
3. Enable the providers you want to use (Google, GitHub)
4. Configure OAuth settings for each provider

### 3. Environment Variables Not Set

**Problem**: App shows "Supabase environment variables not found" warnings.

**Solution**:
1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Add your Supabase credentials:
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```
3. Restart your development server

### 4. Database Tables Missing

**Problem**: Users can sign up but get errors when trying to access features.

**Solution**:
1. Follow the database setup in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
2. Run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL Editor
3. Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) policies are set up correctly

## üîß Quick Fixes

### Enable Demo Mode (Temporary Solution)

If you're having persistent issues, you can temporarily enable demo mode:

1. Open `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
2. Find this line: `const [isDemoMode, setIsDemoMode] = useState(false);`
3. Change it to: `const [isDemoMode, setIsDemoMode] = useState(true);`

This will bypass Supabase authentication and use demo data.

### Disable Email Confirmation (Development Only)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Only do this for development/testing!**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Settings
3. Disable "Enable email confirmations"
4. Save changes

**Note**: This is not recommended for production as it reduces security.

## üìß Email Configuration

### Check Email Settings

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings
2. Verify your Site URL is correct
3. Check that email templates are configured
4. Ensure your email provider is working

### Test Email Delivery

1. Try signing up with a different email address
2. Check if confirmation emails are being sent
3. Verify email isn't being blocked by spam filters

## üîç Debug Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for:
- Network errors
- Authentication errors
- Supabase connection issues

### 2. Check Supabase Logs

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. Look for authentication-related errors
3. Check for failed login attempts

### 3. Verify Environment Variables

```bash
# Check if variables are loaded
console.log('Supabase URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL)
console.log('Supabase Key:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
```

## üÜò Getting Help

### 1. Check Supabase Status
- Visit [status.supabase.com](https://status.supabase.com)
- Ensure Supabase services are operational

### 2. Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Email not confirmed" | Account not verified | Check email for confirmation link |
| "Invalid login credentials" | Wrong email/password | Verify credentials |
| "Unsupported provider" | OAuth not configured | Enable providers in Supabase |
| "Network error" | Connection issues | Check internet and Supabase status |

### 3. Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the logs**: Look at browser console and Supabase logs
2. **Verify setup**: Ensure you followed `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
3. **Test with demo mode**: Temporarily enable demo mode to isolate the issue
4. **Contact support**: If all else fails, reach out with specific error messages

## üéØ Prevention Tips

1. **Always test authentication flow** after making changes
2. **Keep environment variables secure** and never commit them to git
3. **Regularly check Supabase status** for any service issues
4. **Use demo mode during development** to avoid authentication blockers
5. **Test with multiple email addresses** to ensure email delivery works

## üîÑ Reset Everything

If you're completely stuck:

1. **Clear browser data**: Clear cookies, local storage, and session storage
2. **Restart development server**: Stop and restart your npm/yarn dev command
3. **Check Supabase project**: Ensure your project is active and not suspended
4. **Verify credentials**: Double-check your Supabase URL and API keys
5. **Enable demo mode**: Temporarily bypass authentication to continue development

**Remember**: Authentication issues are common during setup. Take it step by step, and don't hesitate to use demo mode while you work out the kinks! üöÄ
